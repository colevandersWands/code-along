# Code Along

A site for live code-alongs or group studying, as a teacher or a student.  You can edit with blocks or text, and take notes on the side.  

If you come across a great snippet you can save it along with your notes, download them as a JS file, and review them later.  (Or assign them as exercises, or even turn them in as homework).
